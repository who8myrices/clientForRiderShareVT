My job for this project was to work on the login and rating system for the project. 
I did get the login to work using google+ api, it let users connect their app with
google+.

I did not get to work on the rating because I didn't have the time, I worked on the
skeleton of the client part of the app. It was pretty much what our group had for the presentation but not as nice looking. The program i wrote isnt very nice looking, 
but it does connect to the server and it does add drivers to the server and it let
riders know the drivers that are availiable in a list.

I just wanted to write about what I did for the project.
